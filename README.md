#  HOMETOWN HOMEPAGE

This is my first solo project from my front-end career path course on https://www.scrimba.com.

I did not keep track of the project because i commited it after building the project but my next commit will be detailed.

I built the project from scratch from a design mockup given to us.

Here is the link to the design https://www.figma.com/file/2QuGfAOcHaZJ6aHXfuamnK/Hometown-Homepage?node-id=121-2&t=IswhB6ZSVSSilhen-0 in case you want to check out.
